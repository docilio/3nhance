# 3nhance
🚀 3Nhance is an AI-powered offline agent that enhances structured data using replies from users via email — including natural text and attached documents or images.

🧠 Built with **Gemma 3n**, **Ollama**, and **n8n**, the pipeline processes real-world human responses, recognizes and extracts relevant data (via `gemma3n`), and generates **SQL insert/update** queries to fill data gaps. A control bot acts as an evaluator, optionally escalating changes to human managers for approval.
